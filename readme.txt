JF Ratt Roads 1.1 (2023-04-13)
------------------------------------

This fork provides a complete set of 24 roadtypes (15 normal and 
[optionally] 9 electrified) plus 2 tramtypes. It has support for 
American, European and Australian road styles, climate-aware graphics, 
plus many parameters for customizing to your preferred playstyle.


WARNING!
===========================================================================

This NewGRF version is not compatible with any version before v1.0.0!

This NewGRF is only compatible with OpenTTD 1.10.0 or later!

===========================================================================

----------
Parameters
----------

There are six parameter settings available:

 1) Roadtype Availability - Year-Dependent (Default) || Always Available
  - This setting affects whether roadtypes are introduced depending on year 
(Default) or if they are always available.

 2) Speed Units: MPH || KM/H || M/S (Default) || KM/H, Custom
  - Choose your preferred units for speed {ORANGE}(make sure this is the same 
as your game setting!){BLACK}. This makes sure your speed limits look 'realistic', 
e.g. no more silly 57 km/h speed limits due to unit conversions. The last option 
allows you to customise speed limits.
 
 3) Difficulty - Normal (Defualt) || No Speed Limits
  - This affects costs and speed limits. Normal is default costs and speed 
limits, while No Speed Limits mostly uses Normal costs but removes speed limits.

 4) Road Style - European/Australian (Default) || American
  - This setting changes the center stripe design which will be displayed, 
switching between American-style yellow stripes or European/Auz/Etc. white stripes.

 5) Enable electrified roads - Off (Default) || On
  - If enabled, this option adds electrified versions of 11 roadtypes for use with 
trolleybuses and other catenary-powered road vehicles. These roadtypes require the 
addition of NRT-enabled vehicle sets to be useful, so are disabled by default.

 6) Enable houses alongside roads faster than (including) 90 km/h, "remote" roads 
and industrial roads - Off (Default) || On
  - By default, houses are forbidden from spawning alongside these roads, 
including Tracks, A-Level, Chidao, Highway, Autobahn and Industrial Roads, which 
can cause towns to disappear if their roads are replaced by these roads. It is 
highly recommended to turn this on for multiplayer servers to prevent griefing 
from malicious or careless players.

 7) Custom speed limits for different type of roads
  - These parameters have their effects if and only if Parameter 2 (Speed Units) 
is set to "KM/H, Custom".
